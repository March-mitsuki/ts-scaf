# TS Scaffold
A CLI scaffold that allows you to quickly build your own TypeScript project with many usefull tools.

(Only Node.js supported for now. Welcome contribute!)

# Why TS Scaffold
Manually setting up a TypeScript project can be a real hassle. Aside from a few major frameworks that maintain their own CLI scaffolds (like Next.js), it's hard to believe there's no good scaffolding tool for creating a clean, pure TypeScript template out of the box!

Thatâ€™s exactly why ts-scaf was born.

With ts-scaf, you can:
- Instantly create a project using our recommended setup
- (WIP) Customize the structure and dependencies via CLI options
- (WIP) Use a config file to define your setup in detail

In short: zero config to get started, and highly customizable when you need it.


# Quick Start
```sh
npx ts-scaf --name my-project

# or
pnpm dlx ts-scaf --name my-project

# or
yarn dlx ts-scaf --name my-projec
```

# Use as a module (WIP)
You can import `ts-scaf` just like any other module, which helps you build your own template project CLI.
```sh
# WIP
```

# The Vision of the TS Scaffold Project
A reusable, modular TypeScript project scaffold.

With a single command, you can create projects from a variety of templates we provide. You can also save a config file and pass it to `ts-scaf` to generate your own custom project templates! Alternatively, upload the config file to Gist or any other platform, and use `ts-scaf` across different environments to instantly scaffold projects with one command.

Our ultimate goal is to free major frameworks from the burden of maintaining their own CLI scaffolding tools. Maintaining a custom CLI (like create-react-app, which is no longer maintained) comes with significant overhead. Instead, frameworks only need to maintain a simple config fileâ€”`ts-scaf` will handle everything else automatically.

Cross-platform support is also a key goal: `ts-scaf` aims to run on all major JavaScript runtimes including Node.js, Deno, and Bun, as well as across both Windows and Unix-like systems. (Only Node.js + Unix-like is supported for now, welcome contribute!)

# The Not-So-Perfect Part
The goal of this project is to generate a repository with 100% TypeScript code. However, if you want the Prettier configuration to work properly with the VSCode plugin, youâ€™re limited to using JSON, YAML, or JS files.

TypeScript files wonâ€™t work because the VSCode plugin doesn't support `--experimental-strip-types` when reading config files.

We decided against using JSON or YAML since they lack proper type support for configuration. In the end, we chose to use a JS file. While this slightly compromises the purity of having a fully TypeScript codebase, it offers a much better developer experience.
